# Nordic.js 2015 - Async and Streaming Programming in JS - We're All Wrong

This is a talk given at [Nordic.js 2015](http://nordicjs.com/) on [Async and Streaming Programming in JS - We're All Wrong](http://nordicjs.com/speakers#118-Matthew-Podwysocki) and the slides are [here](nordic-js).

## Abstract ##

On a dark and fateful day, Promises were adopted as the default asynchronous implementation in JavaScript, much to the chagrin of Node community and the church of small modules. So, we have callbacks, promises, generators? What about streams or even yet WHATWG Streams? What about events? What are we missing to make ourselves the most productive. This talk with deconstruct what we’re doing, how we’re doing it wrong, and have a rather opinionated way of how we move forward with sane async coding. Together we can build a better future, I promise!
